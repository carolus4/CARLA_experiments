# Defining and documenting elements of the world

## Inspecting the world
The recommended approach is spectator navigation, but as far as I can tell, that's a different mental model for runpod (more of a remote desktop). 

Using script-based approaches is the more direct path for now.

Here's what I have so far:
```
Map: Carla/Maps/Town10HD_Opt
Synchronous mode: False
Fixed delta seconds: None

Weather:
  Cloudiness: 20.0
  Precipitation: 0.0
  Sun altitude angle: 45.0

Actors:
  Vehicles: 0
  Walkers: 0
  Sensors: 0
  Traffic lights: 15

Spawn points available: 155
```

And inspecting the world at the end of the previous rendering stack, we see `Vehicles: 1` and `Sensors: 4` as expected.

```
