# Driving through the world

## Visualising the map
We've been running previews through Carla's default [Map10](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/map_town10/).

Creating a route from spawn point 1 to spawn point 10, based on an aerial snapshot + OpenDRIVE lanes:

## Basic Agent driving

Importing the BasicAgent from the Carla repo, we get routing and driving behaviour based on the simulation.
