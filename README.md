# CARLA_experiments

## 01. Run carla on Runpod
Stood up a full CARLA simulation stack on RunPod using an RTX 4090, separated the engine (/opt/carla) from our experiments (/workspace/CARLA_experiments), and got the binary running headless in a containerized cloud environment.

## 02. Sensor Capture
Tested rgb and depth renders out-of-the-box.
Tested editing the camera setup on the test vehicle.
